Check all fluids for condition and level. Oil should not look like chocolate milk, transmission fluid (if an automatic) should be red, not brown, and not smell like burnt almonds. Take the cap off the radiator and see if it's full and make sure it doesn't have gunk floating in it.
Shocks: Bounce it on each corner. If it floats and bobs like a boat after you stop rocking it, the shocks are probably toast.
A bluish tint to the exhaust can mean the rings don't seal well and it burns oil, and a thick white smoke accompanied by a sticky-sweet smell means there's a coolant leak.
If the battery terminals are all corroded and disgusting the owner probably never kept up with routine maintenance or even checked under the hood.
